Design:
sign-in page -> Todos page  ----> other route --> page-not-found page

Todos page:
main component - Todos component 
                        - Todo-header (input for user to enter a todo)
                        - Todo-list (display list of todos)
                            - todo-item ( todo )
                        - todo-footer (items remaining)


input elements -> States -> Pristine, touched, Dirty
Reactive forms:
    1) create Formcontrolname
    2) assign formcntrol to formgroup (segregate your form elements)
    3) create formgroup instance in ts file. create individual form controls but better way is to use form Builder.
    4) inject formbuilder. get instance of formgroup from formbuilder which will generate your form controls.
    5) make formcontrols as required by setting validators.required.
    6) display error message by checking if the input fields are touched.
